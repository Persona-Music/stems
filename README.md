# Stem Generation

A small demo used to extract stems from a track in Google Drive.

The input is expecting a Google Drive link that looks like this:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uYSFO1BHv120gHte2S189l24ZFcSCNAU/view?usp=drive_link

Once a valid link is added, a button will appear to generate stems.
